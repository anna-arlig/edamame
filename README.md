## Learnings and challenges

This was my first time setting up a React Native project. I learned about structuring a project. This was supposed to be a smaller project so 
I didn't want to go overboard with the architecture but still make it scallable. My biggest challenge was implementing dotenv in the 
project which led to me unintentionally pushing stuff that shouldn't be pushed. My second challenge was the safe are view combined with React 
Navigation. Both of these were really unexpected problems.
